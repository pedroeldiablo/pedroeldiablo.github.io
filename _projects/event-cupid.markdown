<h3>Event Cupid</h3>

<h3>Languages and Technologies</h3>

JQuery , SCSS, Mongo, Git, Google Maps and External API

Bringing together data from a hosted Restful API of users, an external API from Skiddle - an events website and Google Maps, the idea behind the project was to make dating both easier and more enjoyable. The premise was to find the midpoint between two users and then using bounds provide them with a selection of events that would be easy for them both to reach. Solving two problems, what to do and where to go in one simple step.
