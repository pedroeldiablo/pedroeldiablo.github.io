<h3>Journal Maps</h3>

<h3>Languages and Technologies</h3>

Rails API (Postgres /ActiveRecord) and Angular JS

A solo project using a Rails API and Angular JS front-end. The concept behind the site is to allow users to add their favourite places to visit and then build walks around them.

Utilising the Google Maps API and the places, geometry and directions libraries to find and then plan journeys between stops. The Rails API stored information about users, their walks as well as the stops that they have created.
