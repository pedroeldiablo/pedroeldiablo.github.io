<h3>Seeing Red</h3>

Game Project - Solo

<h3>Languages and Technologies</h3>

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git

Starting with the brief to create a game I developed a project around the ideas of how to make testing for colourblindness a more inclusive and interactive experience.

The game play relied on JavaScript functions to both generate the board and to keep track of the score.

The palette for the standard version is a tonal selection meaning that players with the most common forms of colourblindness should be able to play without any disadvantage.

The idea was to develop this further with levels built with colour palettes that would be more difficult to play with certain forms of colourblindness. Taking average scores across the different versions would provide an indication of where a player might have a degree of colour vision deficiency.
